# Sunfounder Raspberry Pi experiments

This is a repo of Rasberry Pi lessons in Python using the Sunfounder Super Kit
and Sensor kit. I'm editing the files on a Raspberry Pi 2 and I wanted version
control to save my work in case I need to re-image the Pi's SD card. I also 
want to get more familar with using Github.
